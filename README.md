# Vehicle-License-Plate-Detection
In an ALPR system, the first and most vital phase is the identification and extraction of number plate. This section intends about locating the vehicle number plate from the video frame or image of the captured vehicle. A well known Indian automobile number plate is a metallic rectangular plate bearing an alphanumeric ID of 9/10 digits connected to a motor vehicle. An ALPR system extracts number plate bearing the existence of increased vertical and horizontal edges and most eminent corner points due to contrast characters on the vehicle license plate. But in some cases, as mentioned in the literature review, this
process can detect a non-license plate region, each of which has unique complexity and difficulty. The proposed approach is a fusion of edge analysis, morphological operations, Connected Component Analysis (CCA) and global image features such as area, aspect ratio, length of column-row, spectrum analysis, and detection of corner points. This part reviews explanation on the suggested number plate identification and extraction algorithm.
